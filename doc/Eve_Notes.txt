Note for firmware design:

1.1 USE CLR.B instead of CLR in rx.asm &rfid_Handles.asm (or other *.asm, because CLR=CLR.W not CLR.B)
	correct:
			CLR   &PRXIFG
			CLR   &PRXIE
   	 to	        CLR.B &PRXIFG 
			CLR.B &PRXIE

1.2 in rfid_Handles.asm 
	clear PIN_RX_EN after use to save power     
        such as: 
	

    ;STEP2: Wakeup and 	  Parse--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
	BIC		#(GIE), SR				;[1] don't need anymore bits, so turn off Rx_SM
	BIC.B   #PIN_RX_EN, &PRXEOUT    ;@us_change
	CLR		&TA0CTL

2 (suggested by TI) Configure unused or idle I/O to input/pull down to avoid leakage when it is floating.
  
3 make sure check the RN16 when receiving ACK

4 DCO CLK changing frequence should be optimized, in rfid_Handles.asm, DCO CLK is duplicated changed. 

5 (suggest) configure UCSCTL1 before UCSTL0 (have wired issue sometimes if not do this)

6 remember remove debug pin config once finish debuging

Note for Users:
1 8 I/0 pin is reserved for Tx during RFID Tx period (could not been used as Output pin for other app) 

2 one whole I/O port (include Rx pin) interrupt routine is configure in rx.asm,
should it be accessed for user? 

3 Inside the myACKhook,Readhook,Writehook,
TA0CTL,TA0CCTL0-TA0CCTL1 make sure TA0 is reseted (TA0 is used as counter in LMP3 in Timer0A1_ISR.asm during rfid_dorfid.asm) 

4(suggest) full driven strengh for output which is driven as power suppy
