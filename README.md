WISP 5
====

Welcome to the WISP 5 firmware repository!

Configuration
----
1. Set your Code Composer Studio v5x workspace to wisp5/ccs and import the following projects:

 * **wisp-base** The standard library for the WISP5. Compiled as a static library.
 * **run-once** An application which generates a table of random numbers and stores them to non-volatile memory on the WISP, for use in slotting protocol and unique identification.

 * **simpleAckDemo** An application which references wisp-base and demonstrates basic communication with an RFID reader.

2. Build wisp-base and then the two applications.

3. Program and run your WISP5 with run-once, and wait for LED to pulse to indicate completion.

4. Program and run your WISP5 with simpleAckDemo and ensure that it can communicate with the reader. Use an Impinj Speedway series reader with Tari = 12.5us, link frequency = 160kHz, and reverse modulation type = FM0.

Enjoy the WISP5, and please contribute your comments and bugfixes here!
